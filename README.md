# javascript
These projects cover essential JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, API integration, and asynchronous programming, making them ideal for hands-on learning
How JavaScript Topics Are Implemented in Projects
DOM Manipulation:
Used in almost every project to update the UI dynamically based on user actions or data changes (e.g., updating task lists, displaying quiz questions, changing colors).

Event Handling:
Essential for interactivity-listening for clicks, form submissions, or keyboard events (e.g., button clicks in games, form validation).

Arrays & Objects:
Store and manage data such as lists of tasks, quiz questions, or card pairs in memory games.

Fetch API & Asynchronous JS:
Fetch data from external APIs (e.g., weather data, recipes, currency rates) and update the UI when data arrives.

Conditional Logic:
Drives decision-making in games, validations, and calculations (e.g., checking quiz answers, determining game outcomes).

Timers (setInterval, setTimeout):
Used for clocks, countdowns, sliders, and animations.

Local Storage:
Persists data like to-do lists or user settings between sessions.

Form Validation:
Ensures user input is correct before processing or submitting forms.
